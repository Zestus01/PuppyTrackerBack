You’ll store this data in a fixtures directory inside your app.

You can load data by calling manage.py loaddata <fixturename>, 
where <fixturename> is the name of the fixture file you’ve created. 
Each time you run loaddata, the data will be read from the fixture 
and reloaded into the database. Note this means that if you change 
one of the rows created by a fixture and then run loaddata again, 
you’ll wipe out any changes you’ve made.

python manage.py dumpdata songs.model_name --indent 4 > songs/fixtures/model_name.json
Indents help for readability. 

Load Data:
python manage.py loaddata fixtures/model_name.json --app app.model_name
python manage.py loaddata songs/fixtures/song.json -- app songs.song

$ python manage.py loaddata songs/fixtures/*.json
